# Vue Academy Demo App

Demo Project coded during a <a href="https://vue.ac" target="_blank">Vue Academy Workshop</a> in 2021.

## Local installation

You need to restore the npm dependencies first:
Run `npm i`

## Run it locally

Run `npm run serve` for a dev server (or use vue ui).
The app is running on `http://localhost:8080/` and will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
